# Fullstack 2023/1 – React (15.5.2023 to 5.6.2023)

## 🏢 Meta
- We're moving the classes in week 22
  - Wednesday, 31.5. -> Tuesday, 30.5.
  - Friday, 2.6. -> Thursday, 1.6.

## ✏️ Homework

- **Monday, 15.5.2023:**  
  Try scaffolding multiple React projects with vite and inside of these projects try creating multiple React components.
- **Wednesday, 17.5.2023:**  
  - Either take your own, existing code from the "travel blog" or alternatively take the code from [`homework/lesson02/index.html`](homework/lesson02/index.html) and move it into a new React app. Then split it up into sensible components (more than 3). Finally, decide to add some `props` to your components so we can easily change the dynamic parts of the page.
  - Get comfortable with the [official React documentation](https://react.dev). Please read (or at least skim) the ["Describing the UI"](https://react.dev/learn/describing-the-ui) section up until the "Passing Props to a component" subpage.
- **Monday, 22.5.2023:**
  - Keep on extending/completing the last homework: Create components from the given [`template file`](homework/lesson02/index.html) and add sensible Props to all/most of your components.
  - Implement conditional rendering into your components where it makes sense (please try to use all three types: default values/Logical OR, Logical AND and the ternary operator) 
  - Read the official React documentation including [`conditional rendering`](https://react.dev/learn/conditional-rendering)
